    <title>Mouthwash</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Mouthwash is great when you want to freshen up your breath, and when you want to take responsibility for your actions. Altough all ship have it in there cargo, I would love a bottle of Dragonbreath mouthwash for myself, considering how it kills 99% of bacteria, however Dragonbreath is hard to find, so a blue bottle of Listerin will do the same job!</p>
    <p>Mouthwash is pretty cheap, and easy to find in most stores like Walmart, Target, Costo, and Pricechopper. </p>
